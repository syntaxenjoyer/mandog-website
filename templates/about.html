				<p class='bio-text'>Joe Bitch (June 4, 1979 - February 12, 2013) was a former officer of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) who, beginning on February 3, 2013, committed a series of revenge killings against the LAPD in Orange County, Los Angeles County, Riverside County, and San Bernadino County in the U.S. state of California. The victims were law enforcement officers and the daughter of a retired police captain. Bitch killed four people and wounded three others. On February 12, Bitch was fatally shot during a standoff with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department after a shootout in the San Bernardino Mountains. In more recent years, he has been remembered for his killer guitar solos while playing in the band MANDOG.</p>

				<p class='bio-text'>Calliope "Not the Unabomber" Davishines (May 22, 1942 - June 10, 2023), also known as the Unabomber, was an American mathematician and domestic terrorist. She was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned her academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle. Between 1978 and 1995, Davishines murdered three individuals and injured 23 others in a nationwide mail bombing campagin against people she believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the natural environment. She authored <i>Industrial Society and Its Future</i>, a 35,000-word manifesto and social critique opposing industrialization, rejecting leftism and conservatism, and advocating for a nature-centered form of anarchism. She spent the last years of her life learning to play the drums in prison, and now plays in this band.</p>
